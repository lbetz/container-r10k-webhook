## Introduction

This container is designed for deploying Puppet code using r10k triggered by webhooks. It includes the webhook-go daemon and r10k gem along with all necessary dependencies pre-installed, ensuring a seamless deployment process.

## Usage

To run r10k, simply execute the container. The r10k binary is set as the default entrypoint. The container operates as the puppet user with a UID/GID of 999. You can use a shared volume with a Puppet server and mount it at `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments`.

```yaml
services:
  webhook:
    image: image: ghcr.io/voxpupuli/r10k-webhook:2.9.0
    ports:
      - 4000:4000
    environment:
      - PUPPET_CONTROL_REPO="https://git.example.org/puppet/control.git"
      - USER="puppet
      - PASSWORD="puppet
      # For using HTTPS enable tls and uncomment the following lines
      #- TLS=true
      #- TLS_CERT="/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/puppet.pem"
      #- TLS_KEY="/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/private_keys/puppet.pem"
    volumes:
      - ./code:/etc/puppetlabs/code
      # For using HTTPS enable tls above and mount your key/cert directory
      #- openvoxserver-ssl:/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl
```
